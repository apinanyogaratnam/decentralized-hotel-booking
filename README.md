# Decentralized Hotel Booking

notes:
- frontend checks and restricts if rooms are already occupied
- there won't be an error for indexes since user clicks on the room which generates and index
- request room rates in frontend 20000000000000000, 40000000000000000, 60000000000000000
- need to call checkout and pay at the same time in the frontend
